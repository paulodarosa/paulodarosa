# Hey, there! I'm Paulo. I'm a Data Engineer

I'm Paulo DaRosa, based in Curitiba / Brazil. Currently working for a small company as commercial manager and my main role is to increase the online sales of hydraulic and brass connectors for gas and petroleum.
Right after starting Computer Engineering and Math, I decided to merge my marketing and coding skills and now I looking for a position as **data engineer** or **data scientist**. 

## Working as a Marteker
I've been doing marketing related tasks since 2011, back when I started as an undergrad student. I spent few years working as **political marketer**, more specific as a social media creating content and improving public relations opinion and creating a positive branding image for 2 politicals figures in Brazil. After that, I focused on digital marketing and processes related to **e-commerce**.  

## Working as a Data Engineer and Data Scientist
These roles follows my current experience as a commercial manager. The need for data to make better business decisions made me dive into the **big data** field. Since the questions and decisions are made by myself (as a marketing guy) and always short-staffed, I had to right down some code in **python**, query data using **sql** and analyse the data I needed. The need of having contact with the data during all the process, getting your hands dirty doing **ETL**, creating **data lakes** and running some **statistical and predective models** helped me understand the journey that the data makes till it reaches its final point: help companies to make better data-driven decisions.
